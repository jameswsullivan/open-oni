Page Title: This must be the first line

<p>
  This is the body of the page.  It must start on the third line.  The second
  line should be blank, though it could be anything at all: it's ignored
  entirely.

<p>
  You can use <em>any</em> standard HTML markup.  You can probably even use
  some django magic, but don't ask me what or how....
</p>

<p>
  This page will always be available as an example.  Drop any other pages with
  this same formatting into this <code>pages/</code> folder in order to have
  them routable.  To view this page, enable the plugin and visit the URL for
  your static pages, such as <code>http://example.com/static/example</code>.
